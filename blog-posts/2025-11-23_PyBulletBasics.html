            <h2>PyBullet Basics: R2D2 Robot Movement and Object Picking</h2>
            <p><em>November 23, 2025</em></p>

            <p>
                This is my first foray into the world of robotics programming in physics simulations.
                There's lots to learn -- for example, URDF files and robot specifications, as well as
                specifics
                of interacting with and manipulating robots in PyBullet.
                The ultimate result
                is a basic python program that runs a PyBullet simulation where the user can
                use keyboard commands to move the robot in all directions on the plane
                and manipulate the gripper pole
                and claw to pick and place objects. <br> <br>

                The biggest challenge is adapting to realistic physics simulation.
                For example, previously, in graphics or simple game development, to move an object
                one can simply 'teleport' it to the desired location and continuously change its position
                to simulate movement and even acceleration. But in a physics simulation, 'teleporting'
                the body bypasses all the collision and physics simulation logic.
                At first, I tried this 'teleportation' approach but quickly realized the robot was
                phasing through objects. So forces and velocities need to be properly applied to
                the appropriate components. <br> <br>

                It took some time to understand how these 'components' are specified.
                In PyBullet (and URDF in general), a robot comprises 'joints' and 'links'.
                The joints define the tree strucuture of the robot's components.
                The links are
                the actual visible and physics elements of the robot
                and are connected by joints. So joints are edges and links are nodes. <br> <br>

                Each joint is specified by an x-y-z coordinate (and I believe optionally an orientation).
                This is the location of the joint in terms of its parent's 'frame'.
                I understand the word 'frame' to be the robotics term for
                'reference frame' or 'reference coordinate system'. The joint does not really 'exist'
                and cannot be seen, but it is the connector of the parent 'link' and child 'link'.
                The joint's location (and orientation) defines the 'frame' or coordinate system for its
                children (the single immediate child link and all joints stemming from it) --
                it defines a new 'origin'. <br> <br>

                The links specify an inertial frame, visual frame, and collision frame, all based off the
                the frame defined by the joint to its parent. The inertial frame roughly specifies the center of mass,
                the visual frame what you see, and the collision frame the collision geometry the physics engine
                detects. <br> </br>

                There is a base link that serves as the root of the tree. Its origin is the world origin. <br> <br>

                Now, in PyBullet specifically, the joints and links are indexed. Each joint and its immediate child link
                have the same index. The base is indexed by -1. In the program, I print information regarding each joint
                as well as
                each link. This is useful for determining the positions of components, which links I can manipulate, the
                extent of their range of
                motion,
                and their type of movement (via the 'joint type').<br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                In addition, I also obtain the 'dynamics' information for each link. This tells me among other things,
                the mass and friction of the link. <br> <br>

                <br> <br>

                Putting it all together, I created a video of the program demonstrating robot movement and object pick
                and place. Due to the default frame rate of the physics simulator, the movement is a bit slow --
                something akin
                to 2001 Space Odyssey (but maybe even slower). <br> <br>

                Video Demonstration (Youtube):

                <br> <br>

                I think in the future, if I want to get serious about graphics and robotics projects, I'm gonna need
                to upgrade my computer hardware. I think I would like to build my own computer!
