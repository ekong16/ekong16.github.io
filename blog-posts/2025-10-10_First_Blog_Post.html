            <h2>My First Blog Post -- Review of Past Projects</h2>
            <p><em>October 10, 2025</em></p>

            <p>
                Welcome to my first blog post!
                In this post, I will simply review some topical past projects of mine.
                The goal is to reflect on past work before starting anything new.

                We review 3 projects: a web based 2D side-scroller game, an implementation of CycleGAN,
                and a cornell box graphics simulation.
            </p>

            <h3> Potato Jump -- Web Based 2D Side Scroller</h3>
            <p>
                Proceeding in chronological order, in high school (around 2015-2016) I created a 2D side-scroller game
                which I called
                "Potato Jump!".
                It is a Jquery based web game that works well on desktop as well as mobile.
                I fondly recall my sister creating the graphics for me (yes, she designed the potato!). <br> <br>

                To this day, it still runs well, and you can play with it at this
                <a target="_blank" href="https://ekong16.github.io/JqueryTest/">link</a>. <br> <br>

                I believe this was my first repo on my github. The primary branch is "gh-pages".

            <h3>
                CycleGAN Implementation
            </h3>
            <p>
                In my undergraduate years (around junior or senior year), I took a computer vision course.
                For the final group project, a group of four of us implemented CycleGAN, a deep learning
                generative adversarial network "GAN" used for image to image translation. We were able to
                transform images of zebras into images of horses. <br> <br>

                In this project, I was responsible for implementing the primary training loop in tensor flow.
                I remember I had to implement a custom training loop in a "cycle" using something called a
                "gradient tape". I can't seem to find the source code for this project... <br> <br>

                Here is the brief written by some of my teammates.

                Some actual transformations from our implementation:

            <h3>
                Cornell Box Simulation with Shadows and Physics
            </h3>
            <p>
                In my senior year of undergraduate studies, we were required to take a "capstone course". I elected
                to take computer graphics with the famous Professor Andy Van Dam. This entailed taking an extra
                half-credit lab
                in addition to the regular computer graphics course. It was a phenomenal experience and one of the most
                intellectually stimulating and challenging courses I took. The extra half-credit lab made the course
                significantly more challenging -- I remember only 4 students (including myself) elected to take it! <br>
                <br>

                Throughout the course, we implemented a brush (like in photoshop), shapes rendering, image filtering,
                scene
                rendering, and ray tracing. Many of these were tied together in the final project, which I recorded at
                this
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHWymkbtuRk">
                    Youtube link</a>. <br> <br>

                In the above video, we have balls bouncing around a cornell box.
                It was a partnered project, and
                we mostly used my implementations for the various components.
                My partner created the physics of the bouncing balls. <br> <br>

                I recall getting the shadows to work took tremendous effort, involving intensive GPU level programming,
                which I believe was done in GLSL. <br> <br>

            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                I enjoyed writing this article reviewing some of my past project experiences :) ! I felt a little bit
                nostalgic too.
                It also helped me get the scaffolding of this website set up -- so now I feel ready to expand. Onwards
                and upwards!
